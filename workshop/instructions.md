# TFX Developer Workshop

## Introduction

This workshop is designed to introduce TensorFlow Extended (TFX)
and help you learn to create your own machine learning
pipelines.  We'll follow a typical ML development process,
starting by examining the dataset, and end up with a complete
working pipeline.  Along the way we'll explore ways to debug
and update your pipeline, and measure performance.

## Step by Step

We'll gradually create our pipelines by working step by step,
following a typical ML developer process.  Here are the steps:

1. Setup your environment
1. Bring up initial pipeline skeleton
1. Dive into our data
1. Feature engineering
1. Training
1. Analyzing model performance
1. Deployment to production

## Prerequisites
* (Copy from slides)
* Linux
* Virtualenv
* Python 2.7
* Git

## Workshop Materials

```bash
git clone <something>
```

Along with these instructions you'll be given code in a repo
that you will clone into your environment.  That code will
be organized by the steps that we're working on, so for each
step you'll have the code you need and instructions on what
to do with it.
